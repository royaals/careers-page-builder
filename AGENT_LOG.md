## Session Log

### Session 1: Project Setup & Architecture

**Prompts Used**:
1. "Build a careers page builder with Next.js - explain the assignment requirements"
2. "What's the ideal tech stack for this project?"
3. "Create the Prisma schema for companies, users, sections, and jobs"

**What Worked**:
- AI provided clear project structure
- Database schema was well-designed
- Got complete boilerplate code quickly

**What Needed Refinement**:
- Initial code used Prisma 7.x which had breaking changes
- Had to ask for Prisma 5.x compatible code
- Tailwind v4 config was wrong, needed v3

**Learnings**:
- Always specify version requirements upfront
- AI tends to use latest versions which may have breaking changes
